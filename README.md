# Financial-Data-Modeling-for-Fault-Prediction
Application of AI techniques to build ML models which can capture anomalies (fraud) based on behavior of customers. 


# Dataset Information

## Context
This dataset provides customer and date-level transactions over several years, making it valuable for analyses requiring transaction information, such as Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) analysis. Additionally, it includes response data indicating customer reactions to a promotional campaign.

A key highlight is the dataset's capability to evaluate the effectiveness of RFM groups by examining customer responses.

## Content
- **Transaction Data:**
  - Customer ID
  - Transaction Date
  - Amount of Purchase

- **Response Data:**
  - Binary variable indicating whether the customer responded to a campaign or not.

## Acknowledgements
